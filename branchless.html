      <h1>The Challenge</h1>
      <p>My vision for the bank and for this app was one that would target audiences that typically feel left out by big commercial banks and financial institutions. The challenge was to create an intuitive, time-saving, banking App that still felet human-centric and personalized for Branchless' diverse population of users.<a href="https://github.com/Tater4tot5/branchlessbank/blob/master/Branchless%20Bank%20Creative%20Brief.md">VIEW CREATIVE BRIEF</a></p>

      <h1>My Process</h1>
      <div class="projectpicleft"><img src="images/brcompare.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><img class="number" src="images/number1.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>Competitive Analysis</h2></div>
      <p>I started by researching painpoints users had with major banking apps like Wells Fargo, Chase and Bank of America. the feedback I received from interviews and online forums was: "difficult to find account information and monthly statements," users felt that their was no person-to-person aspect and no easy way to contact customer service through the app. Things I identified what were working well with these apps: the convenience of virtual check-depositing and money transfering/bill pay features.</p></div>
      <div class="projectpicright"><img src="images/branchlessbrand.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><img class="number" src="images/number2.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>Branding and Iconography</h2></div>
      <p>Because I wanted Branchless to feel different from the stiff, corporate, and impersonal styles of other major banks, I opted for a bright color scheme with a logo that played into the "branchless" foliage theme. I designed several logos and ultimately decide to go with a bright green leaf shape signifying wealth and growth and a modern, rounded sans-serif font that felt clean and crisp.</p></div>
      <div class="projectpicleft"><img src="images/brsketch.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><img class="number" src="images/number3.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>Sketches & Wireframes</h2></div>
      <p>With the painpoints from my user research in mind, I sketched out the main screens for the app, starting with an easy and inviting log-in screen and a homepage that greeted the user by name, featured, large and legible CTA buttons, with an option for immediate customer service ("urgent matter"). I decided to keep the same bottom nav on all screens that would offer a feature for users to contact a human at any time and also tell them where they were in the app. I then created wireframes of all of the different screens I would need for the app and created user flows to make sure the app would be intuitive.</p></div>
      <div class="projectpicright"><img src="images/swimiteration.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><img class="number" src="images/number4.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>User Testing and Iterations</h2></div>
      <p>At first I aimed at giving more priority the communal aspect of the site and placed emphasis on integrating social media and share features. However, after a few user tests, I realized people were mostly navigating to the information on pools and training resources. Images were also a huge attraction for users, so I gave visual heirarchy to pool images and the share and "connect" elements on the site were given less priority and tucked away to the side or located at the bottom of content.</p></div>
