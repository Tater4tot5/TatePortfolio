      <h1>The Ultimate Guide to DigitalMarketing</h1>
      <h3>Tools Used: Sketch, Invision, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop </h3>
      <p>I was responsible for creating an interactive, on-line guide to Digital Marketing that would crate brand awareness, drive traffic to DigitalMarketer.com and serve as a lead magnet for DigitalMarketer Products and Events.</p>

      <h1>My Role</h1>
      <p>Our Content team came to me with a 125+ page PDF Document that they wanted to convert into an extensive on-line resource. This resource would be free and available to anyone, but would ultimately serve as a lead magent for the DigitalMarketer Brand. As the UI Designer, I was charged with creating the entire digital experience including the styleguide, graphics, site navigation and page layouts. In addition to creating these assets and mockups for the index page, table of contents, and the interior chapters and pages, I also helped code and build the website.<a class="rfp" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/59349413/Beginners-Guide-to-Digital-Marketing"> VIEW STYLEGUIDE & MOCKUPS</a></p>

      <h1>My Process</h1>
      <div class="projectpicleft"><img class="grcompare" src="images/beginnercompetitor.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><img class="number" src="images/number1.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>Competitive Analysis</h2></div>
      <p>I looked to several competitors for ideas on how to make this longform text document easy to navigate, reference and share. A lot of the online marketing resources I found were incredibly text-heavy and their use of graphics just made the pages feel more cluttered and busy. I also noticed the only way to navigate around these resources was by returning to the table of contents or index page. I really liked the way Medium, DesignBetter.co and Creative Bloq used whitespace to break up their content and the way Google's Material.io introduced their guide with a "Getting Started" page and then kept the navigation anchored to the left side of the page on all of the interior pages. Since another goal was to drive traffic and create brand awareness, I also wanted to encourage users to share this content as they were consuming it. I how easy it was to share from Medium where they would isolate impactful quotes and on hover offer different sharing options with just a click.</p> </div>
      <div class="projectpicright"><img src="images/beginnerstyle.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><img class="number" src="images/number2.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>Branding and Iconography</h2></div>
      <p>At the time of creating this on-line guide, DigitalMarketer's website used a Flat UI color palette that included colors from all over the color wheel. The styleguide included two similar sans-serif fonts, Avenir and Helvetica Neue and the DM logo used a bright green and red. I liked how Invision's DesignBetter.co resources used limited but impactful graphics and branding that didn't distract from the page content. In order to stay on-brand with DM, but not detract attention from the guide's textual content, I decided to use just one font-family - Avenir, for the guide, and I used the bright green from the DM logo as an accent color and selected a more analgous color palette that would be a bit easier on the eyes.</p></div>
        <!-- <div class="projectpicleft"><img src="images/brsketch.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><img class="number" src="images/number3.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>Sketches & Wireframes</h2></div>
      <p>With the painpoints from my user research in mind, I sketched out the main screens for the app, starting with a personalized log-in screen and homepage that featured large and legible CTA buttons. To keep the human-centric feel, I made the option for immediate customer service available on the homescreen "urgent matter" and accross all screens in the bottom nav ("urgent matter"). I then created lo-fi wireframes of all of the different screens I would need for the app so that I could test several user flows and make sure the app would be intuitive to each experience.</p></div>
      <div class="projectpicright"><img src="images/brtakeaway.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><img class="number" src="images/number4.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>User Testing and Takeaways</h2></div>
      <p>This app went through many small iterations including the removal of redundant CTA items and busy background images. Users were confused by the "$" icon and noted that the icon to "view/manage account" was different on the homescreen than the bottom navigation, even though both icons lead users to the accounts page. Given more time, I would have created icons unique to this app so all icons would be in sync and offer a more streamlined user experience. </p></div>
