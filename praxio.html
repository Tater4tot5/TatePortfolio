    <h1>Praxio App & Website</h1>
    <h3 style="line-height:1.6">Tools used: Sketch, Invision, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, WordPress, Zeppelin</h3>
    <p>I was the lead designer at Praxio, a sister company to DigitalMarketer. Praxio is a "Knowledge Management Platform" aimed at simplifying the process of sharing specialized knowledged within an organization. It could be described as a company wiki where users can freely upload, customize and exchange resources and managers can easily onboard and train employees. In addition to leading the design of this application, I was also tasked with designing the Praxio.com website and affiliate pages.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <h1>My Role</h1>
      <p>As the only Designer on the Praxio team, I was able to play a part in every aspect of designing this product. In addition to heading the UI/UX Research, Design and Development of the application, I created the Praxio styleguide, custom graphics and icons, animations, company mascot, onboarding, and emails. I also designed and helped build the Praxio.com website where users were able to learn about the app, its pricing and its features.</p>

    <div class="process">
      <h1>My Process</h1>
      <div class="projectpicleft"><img class="prcompare" src="images/prcompare.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><img class="number" src="images/number1.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>Competitive Analysis</h2></div>
      <p>The original vision for Praxio was an e-learning platform for companies and business owners to upload customized trainings and processes and then track their employees. In this phase I looked to competitors like Lessonly, Guru and Evernote for ideas on creating video trainings and quizzes. I looked at the different dashboards and reporting for instructors and learners. However, as we interviewed and tested more users, Praxio grew to become a file-sharing and social platform, in addition to e-learning. In this phase, I began to look to competitors like Google Drive, Dropbox and Slack. </p></div>
      <div class="projectpicright"><img src="images/prstyle.png"></div><div class="projectdiv" style="margin-top:2rem"><img class="number" src="images/number2.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>Branding and Styleguide</h2></div>
      <p>When considering the UI and the branding for Praxio, I had to consider the 3 main user types 1) the Super Admins who would likely be business owners and executives 2) Admins, who would be managers and team leads uploading and assigning content and 3) Basic users who would be consuming content. Since the latter two users would be using the app more frequently, I wanted the UI to be colorful, but still professional and have lots of white space so as not to seem cluttered or overwhelming. Our President was adamant about having a "bright" green in our logo to signify growth and energy. I chose analgous colors for the logo and UI to keep the app looking clean and used gradients when appropriate to add modernity and depth. In accordance with the the fresh, modern look and feel of the app, I chose Avenir as the primary font family.</p></div>
      <div class="projectpicleft" style="margin-bottom: 2rem"><img class="prcompare" src="images/prmock.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><img class="number" src="images/number3.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>Wireframes, Mockups and Prototyping</h2></div>
      <p>I created two Sketch files for Praxio. One file for all the mockups for the Praxio website, and one for all the mockups and prototypes of the Praxio application and all of it's features. Not surprisingly, the Praxio App Sketch file was quite large and included several pages for each part of the app. I would typically create lo-res mockups walking through the user flow of a part of the app, and once approved, I would create hi-res mockups and sometimes working protoypes of a feature within the app.</p></div>
    <!--<div class="projectpicright"><img src="images/grtakeaway.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><img class="number" src="images/number4.png"><div class="numberheader"><h2>Challenges and Takeaways</h2></div>
      <p>In my original sketches, I wanted a slider at the top of the page showcasing books from each category (inspired by Netflix and Amazon). However, after reconsidering the user experience, I realized a slider would be unncessary because Goodreads users would be visiting the "My Books" page to add and sort books they've already read, not to discover new books. I encountered several roadblocks and challenges when it came to coding my design. Ideally, I would have had a prominent search bar located at the top of the page just below the navigation. Given more time, I would have implemented this with a javascript plugin.</p></div>
